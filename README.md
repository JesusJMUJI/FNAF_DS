# Five Night's at Freddy's - Nintendo DS edition

## Powered by devKitPro, a lot of nights, coffee and a ruined Christmas.

> A highly experimental, colledge assignement game, remake of Five Night's at Freddy's for the Nintendo DS with devKitPro
>
> Project done as a final college assignment for the subject: VJ1214 - VIDEO GAME CONSOLES AND DEVICES.

This is a very experimental clone of the videogame [Five Night's at Freddy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s) for the Nintendo DS. The game was developed using the [devKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) toolchain and the [libNDS](https://libnds.devkitpro.org/) library.

I've opened the source code so my colleages and other people can learn and improve from this code, as this was done by a very much beginner of C++.

Also, the code is very messy as they didn't teach us properly how to code in C++ or how to use devKitPro and libDNS.
